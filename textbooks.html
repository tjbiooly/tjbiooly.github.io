<h1 style="margin-top:150px;margin-left:50px;">RECOMMENDED TEXTBOOKS</h1>
<div style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;">
    <br><p style="font-weight:bold;">**Downloadable copies of Campbell and Reece 7th and 9th editions are posted in <a href="https://tjbiologyolympiad.sites.tjhsst.edu/resources">Resources</a>. </p>
    <p>Note: All of the textbook names have been linked to their Amazon pages (for their specific editions; feel free to take a look at other editions) if you're interested in getting a copy. Used books typically work just as well as new books, so be sure to take a look at the used books (they may persuade you with their prices as compared to those of the new ones).</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Neil-Campbell/dp/0805371710" style="font-style:italic;">Campbell and Reece 7th edition</a> - This is the textbook used in the AP Biology class at school. It's a standard and very solid text that is a must-have study companion for the Olympiad, or any other biology examination. The 7th edition works well, but older or newer versions are fine since not too much has changed from edition to edition. However, the "official" IBO Campbell edition is the 8th.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Jonathan-B-Losos/dp/0072965819" style="font-style:italic;">Raven's Biology 8th edition</a> - This covers topics in more detail than Campbell and Reece does, and includes almost everything on the Olympiad. If you feel like you know Campbell cover-to-cover, this is probably a good next step for studying.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biology-Plants-Peter-H-Raven/dp/1572590416" style="font-style:italic;">Raven's Plants 6th edition</a> - This is a very in-depth textbook on plants. It's about 2/3 the size of Campbell and Reece but is devoted completely to plants, which were covered in just two chapters in Campbell. You probably won't need this until much later, so don't look for this right away. According to Amazon product reviews, the 7th edition is missing two units that are instead online, so I got the 6th edition (and it does have everything).</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Bruce-Alberts/dp/0815341059" style="font-style:italic;">Alberts's Molecular Biology 5th edition</a> - I've seen the name of this textbook thrown around repeatedly in relation to the Olympiad, but I am not sure whether it's actually very helpful or too high-level. The 5th edition has omitted several chapters in favor of including them as a PDF, so if you want the full text in paper you may have to search for another edition.</p>
